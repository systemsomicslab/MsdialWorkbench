# MsdialCoreTestApp

This context covers the MS-DIAL console test application used to exercise core LC/MS workflows, especially EIC handling in the console test app.

## Language

**Peak**:
A detected feature from an MS-DIAL project or alignment result.
_Avoid_: Feature, spot, hit

**EIC**:
Extracted ion chromatogram.
In this context, the same EIC output is produced through two use cases: from raw measurement data with a user-specified m/z, or from an analyzed project by referencing detected peaks.
_Avoid_: TIC, base peak chromatogram

**Project-based EIC**:
An EIC produced from an analyzed project by referencing a detected peak.
_Avoid_: Raw-data EIC, m/z-specified EIC

**Raw-data EIC**:
An EIC produced directly from measurement data using a user-specified m/z.
_Avoid_: Project-based EIC, peak-referenced EIC

**RT correction**:
Retention time correction used to adjust chromatogram peaks across files before downstream export or alignment.
_Avoid_: Retention shift, time warping
