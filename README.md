# About LBM file in MS-DIAL project
The LBM (*.LBM2) file contains the in silico MS/MS spectra of lipids.
There are currently three files named with 'FiehnO (Oliver Fiehn laboratory)', 'AritaM (Makoto Arita laboratory)', and 'SaitoK (Kazuki Saito laboratory)'.
These files contain the same MS/MS spectra information but have different predicted retention times which were optimized for the indivisual method.
One of the '.LBM' files which contains lipid's in silico MS/MS should be also in the same folder as 'MSDIAL.exe' for Lipidomics project. 

# Further
MRMPROBS software suite is sutable for targeted metabolomics and lipidomics, and it also supports MRM/SRM data.
